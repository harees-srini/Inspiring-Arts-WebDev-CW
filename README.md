# Inspiring Arts
This website is a virtual gallery that contains art from medieval Europe. Users can navigate through the website, click and view a small history regarding a painting and visit the shop to purchase items. 
I worked on three pages of the website using HTML, CSS and JS. This was done as a team for a coursework in Web Design and Development.
